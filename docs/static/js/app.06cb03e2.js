Currently, my efforts are focusing on removing a global lock that surrounds compilation and improving the LLVM-based memory management subsystem to support multithreaded compilation. Additionally, I am in charge of migrating Julia from LLVM's old pass manager to LLVM's new pass manager, which promises more aggressive analysis caching to further reduce time spent in compilation.

Additionally, I moved much of the processing from Python into the SQL query itself, which allowed the database processor to more efficiently retrieve records and further reduced memory consumption of python objects. I then added a number of new inputs to the model to improve its prediction capabilities using information available in the central database.

Additionally, I carefully designed the program to be robust and save enough data to replicate segmentation faults and other signal-based program crashes while also incrementally compressing the saved data on the fly to reduce memory and disk usage.
