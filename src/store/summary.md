I'm a Master of Engineering student at MIT working on performance improvements for the [Julia compiler](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Apchintalapudi+). I'm interested in designing and implementing efficient, performant, and resilient software systems that are also readable and maintainable. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment, where ideas are refined to a minimalistic yet powerful solution to the problem at hand. I'm often described as a dedicated individual, who will finish their assigned tasks on time.
