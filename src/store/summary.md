I'm an M. Eng. student at MIT working on speeding up the Julia compiler. I'm interested in writing efficient, performant, and resilient software systems that are also readable and maintainable. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment, where ideas are bounced around between multiple people to refine them to a minimalistic yet powerful solution to any of a variety of problems that are up for grabs. My friends at school describe me as a dedicated individual, who will take time out of their day to help anyone struggling with a problem without hesitation. More than anything, I value creating high quality code that meets or exceeds industry standards for performance and good practices. I'm in my final year of my M. Eng., and am looking for a job for the upcoming year in 2023.
